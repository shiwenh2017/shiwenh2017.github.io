          <p>Set in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, the movie centers around a young, handsome playboy Yuddy (Leslie Cheung). Initially, he steals the hearts of a young department store clerk, Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung), but moves onto another woman, a dancer known on stage as Mimi (Carina Lau). Li-zhen is hurt from Yuddy’s playfulness and eventually Mimi loses him too and bears her emotional suffering, as Li-zhen did. Hanging around with Yuddy is his best friend Zeb (Jacky Cheung), who has a crush on Mimi. Li-zhen meets a young policeman, known as Tide (Andy Lau), who is stoically and rather distantly caring for her. Yuddy eventually leaves for the Philipines to find his biological mother, while Tide also heads to the Phillipines to become a sailor. The film ends notably with a young gambler preparing himself to head out into the streets.</p>

            <p>Featuring an ensemble cast of Hong Kong actors and actresses, <class="movie_name">Days of Being Wild</class> is the first film by Wong Kar Wai in which he truly establishes his distinctive visual style. Some consider it to be the start of his true artistic career, with some calling it ‘the first typical "Wong Kar-wai film".’ This is not surprising, given that this film marked the beginning of his collaboration with two people that have often been central to his later films which were distinctively “Wong Kar-Wai”: Christopher Doyle for cinematography and Tony Leung as a main actor. Days of Being Wild uses vivid colors, like most of his later films, with green and blue saturating the film throughout. The film has a style and feel not of youth, but an indulgance into youth, while filled with energy and vibrance. It brings out the tumultous, but exciting and romantically adventurous days of men and women’s early 20s.</p>
