            <p>2046 is a critically successful film despite not being as world reknowned as In The Mood For Love. 2046 is the last of the films in the trilogy and is an actual sequal to In The Mood For Love. In The Mood For Love is only a loose or indirect sequel to The Days of Being Wild, having a similar setting and similarly named characters. It is interesting to note that 2046 is the only actual sequel that Wong has ever filmed for any one of his films. 2046 is actually more of a sequel in theme to The Days of Bein Wild, because here the main characer is promiscuous and is not binded by any one relationship. The film also no longer focuses on just 2 characters and instead focuses on a number of them. Zhang Ziyi’s performance was a stunning surprise here, with many critics hailing her as a central force in the film. The movie would go onto win many recognitions, including many best film of the year.</p>
