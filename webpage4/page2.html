          <p>Set also in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, the movie revolves around two people who’s spouses have been cheating on each other. A journalist Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung) moves into an apartment building, while an office secretary Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) also happens to move in, and they become neighbors. Their spouses often come home late, and eventually they Chow and Su find out that their spouses have been cheating on them and seeing each other. Hurt and curious, Chow and Su meet up and enact and try to figure out how their spouses may have met. Chow begins writing a martial arts story, and Su helps him. They soon begin to develop feelings for each other, but neither explicitly acknowledges this, and even says they would never stoop to the level of their spouses. Chow leaves to Singapore for a job, asking Su to come, but before Su could make it, Chow leaves.</p>

            <p>In The Mood For Love is perhaps Wong’s most famous film, and also his most critically successful. The film has been considered amongst the greatest films of all time by many. Leung would also win the Cannes Best Actor at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, the second Chinese person to win the award and one of the less than handful of Asian winners. Unlike Days of Being Wild, which features a host of actors and actresses, In The Mood For Love focuses only on two characters, who are in nearly every one of the film’s scenes. Because of this, the film is very concentrated and dense, dense with the chemistry between two people and their developing feelings for each other. From the story to the imagery to the music, the movie is very subtle and marks a maturity and mastery in Wong’s work. In The Mood For Love can be considered to be the climax of Wong’s career.</p>
