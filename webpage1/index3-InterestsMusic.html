    <h1>Interests: Music</h1>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Music</span> is one of the most important things in my life. I may not play an instrument, but listening to music is one aspect of my life I can hardly imagine living without. When I was just a kid, music was not like this for me, but the older I got, the more important music became. In emotional times as a teenager in high school, music expressed my unbearable and overwhelming emotions. At these times, I listened to Asian music, usually Chinese pop or Japanese pop.

    I also listened to some English music, mainly Tupac. In the early, uneasy, and uncomfortable years of college, the years of not fitting in, I listened to instrumentals. Astor Piazzolla and his tango first brought me into or magnified the depths of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz4k-wzjvmo">despair</a>, and later brought me up and out into <!--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsoC9ny8VA0"> --> liberation<!--</a>-->. Recently, <a style = ";" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ABIkH7m0s">electronic and psychedelic music</a> allowed me to experience in a deeper way, through a more experiential dimension, my psychological and philosophical evolution that I otherwise was only developing cognitively and pushing towards through the efforts of my deliberate attempts at self-development and change.<br>
