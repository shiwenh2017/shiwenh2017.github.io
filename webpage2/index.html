      <p>Wong Kar-Wai is a world-reknowned director from Hong Kong whose films center on love and related visceral themes. His films are visual in nature as it draws in the viewer by its cinematography, colors, and directing. Watching a Wong Kar-Wai movie is less like watching a story animated in real life, and more like watching a piece of art extended in frames or "poetry in motion".</p>
